# Practice of Python import.

# Task goal

Fix the this Python project such that one can do the following:
- Run `entry_point.py` of the `model` folder.
- Run `run_test.py` of the `test` folder.

The fix should not change the folder structure, foldernames, and filenames. Modify the content of the files or create necessary files to do the fix.
